# ILO_Bulletin

This repository contains the code and resources needed to generate an automated bulletin for the International Labour Organization (ILO).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **main.py**: This is the main script for generating the bulletin. It uses data provided in the `data` folder and the HTML template to create the final HTML-formatted bulletin.

- **template.html**: This is the HTML template that defines the layout and style of the bulletin. This file is used as a base to insert news data and generate the final bulletin.

- **data/**: A folder containing JSON files with news data. This data is used by `main.py` to populate the bulletin with the latest news items.

- **sample_bulletin.html**: This is the output file generated by `main.py`. It's the final HTML bulletin ready for distribution or hosting.

## Viewing the bulletin

The generated bulletin can be viewed online at the following URL: [ILO Bulletin](https://josuecaldasv.github.io/ILO_Bulletin/sample_bulletin.html).

This URL hosts the `sample_bulletin.html`.

## How to Generate the bulletin

To generate the bulletin, run the `main.py` script. This script reads the news data from the `data` folder, applies it to the `template.html`, and generates `sample_bulletin.html`, which is the final bulletin file.
